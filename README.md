# Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript

[`changelogithub`](https://github.com/antfu/changelogithub) github action wapper to generate Changelog

## Create an action from this template

Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action

## Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```


## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
